# Chapter 1: Introduction to Vue.js

To set up a development environment for Vue.js, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js: Vue.js requires Node.js to run. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official website: <https://nodejs.org>
2. Install Vue CLI: Vue CLI is a command-line interface that makes it easy to set up a new Vue project. You can install Vue CLI globally using npm (Node Package Manager) by running the following command in your terminal:


```vue
npm install -g @vue/cli
```
3. Create a new project: Once you have installed Vue CLI, you can create a new Vue project by running the following command in your terminal:


```vue
lua`vue create my-project
```
Replace `my-project` with the name of your project. This command will prompt you to choose a preset, which determines the configuration of your project. You can choose the default preset or manually select features you want to include.
4. Run the development server: After creating a new project, navigate to the project directory and run the following command in your terminal:


```vue
npm run serve
```
This command will start the development server and open your project in the browser.

That's it! You now have a working development environment for Vue.js.


Creating a Vue.js application using the Vue CLI is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to create a new Vue.js application:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your new Vue.js application.
2. Run the following command to create a new Vue.js application using the Vue CLI:


```vue
lua`vue create my-app
```
Replace `my-app` with the name of your application.
3. The Vue CLI will prompt you to select a preset for your project. You can choose from a default preset or manually select the features you want to include in your project. Use the arrow keys to select a preset and press Enter to confirm your selection.
4. Once the Vue CLI has finished creating your project, navigate to the project directory by running the following command:


```vue
cd my-app
```
Replace `my-app` with the name of your application.
5. Run the development server by executing the following command:


```vue
npm run serve
```
This will start the development server and open your new Vue.js application in your default web browser.

Congratulations! You have now successfully created a new Vue.js application using the Vue CLI. You can start building your application by modifying the files in the `src/` directory.

A Vue.js application consists of several components, which are reusable Vue instances that can be composed into complex user interfaces. Each component contains its own logic, template, and style, and can communicate with other components through props and events.

Here's a breakdown of the basic structure of a Vue.js application:

1. `main.js`: This is the entry point of your Vue.js application. It creates a new Vue instance and mounts it to a DOM element in your HTML file.
2. `App.: This is the root component of your Vue.js application. It contains the main template and style of your application, as well as any logic that is not specific to a child component.
3. `components/`: This directory contains all the child components of your Vue.js application. Each component is defined in its own `. file, which contains its template, style, and logic.
4. `assets/`: This directory contains any static assets, such as images, fonts, and icons, that are used in your Vue.js application.
5. `router/`: This directory contains the routing configuration for your Vue.js application. You can define routes that map to different components, and handle navigation between them.
6. `store/`: This directory contains the Vuex store for your Vue.js application. Vuex is a state management pattern and library for Vue.js that provides a centralized store for managing the state of your application.
7. `public/`: This directory contains any static files that should be served directly to the client, such as the `index. file that is the entry point of your application.

That's a basic overview of the structure of a Vue.js application. Keep in mind that this is just a general structure, and you can customize it to suit the needs of your application.


Here's how you can create a simple "Hello World" application in Vue.js:

1. Open a text editor or IDE and create a new file named `index..
2. In the `index. file, add the following code:


```vue
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head>
 <title>Hello World</title>
 <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@next"></script>
 </head>
 <body>
 <div id="app">
 {{ message }}
 </div>
 <script>
 const app = Vue.createApp({
 data() {
 return {
 message: 'Hello World'
 }
 }
 })

 app.mount('#app')
 </script>
 </body>
</html>
```
This code defines a new Vue.js application and mounts it to the `#app` element in the HTML file. The `data` object defines a property named `message`, which is used to display the text "Hello World" in the template.
3. Save the `index. file and open it in your web browser.

You should see the text "Hello World" displayed on the page.

That's it! You have successfully created a simple "Hello World" application in Vue.js. This is just the beginning - you can now start building more complex applications using Vue.js components, routing, and state management.

# Chapter 2: Building a To-Do List Application
To add a filter to show completed or active tasks, you can start by defining a computed property that filters the tasks array based on a data property that determines whether to show completed tasks or not.


```vue
computed: {
 filteredTasks() {
 if (this.showCompleted) {
 return this.tasks.filter(task => task.completed)
 } else {
 return this.tasks.filter(task => !task.completed)
 }
 }
},
data() {
 return {
 showCompleted: false,
 tasks: [
 { id: 1, text: 'Learn Vue.js', completed: true },
 { id: 2, text: 'Build a project', completed: false },
 { id: 3, text: 'Deploy to production', completed: false }
 ]
 }
}
```
Then, you can use a checkbox to toggle the `showCompleted` data property and display the filtered tasks in a `v-for` loop.


```vue
<div>
 <label>
 Show completed tasks
 <input type="checkbox" v-model="showCompleted">
 </label>
</div>
<ul>
 <li v-for="task in filteredTasks" :key="task.id">
 {{ task.text }}
 </li>
</ul>
```
This will allow users to toggle between showing completed and active tasks.


# Chapter 3: Building a Weather App
To use an API to get weather data, you can start by installing a package like Axios, which makes it easy to perform HTTP requests from within a Vue component.


```vue
npm install axios
```
Then, you can create a method in your Vue component that uses Axios to fetch weather data from an API. For example, here's a method that fetches the current weather for a given location using the OpenWeatherMap API.


```vue
import axios from 'axios'

export default {
 data() {
 return {
 location: 'New York',
 weather: null
 }
 },
 methods: {
 async fetchWeather() {
 const apiKey = 'your-api-key'
 const url = `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${this.location}&appid=${apiKey}
 try {
 const response = await axios.get(url)
 this.weather = response.data
 } catch (error) {
 console.error(error)
 }
 }
 }
}
```
In this example, the `fetchWeather` method makes an asynchronous HTTP GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API using the `axios.get` method. The response is then stored in the `weather` data property of the component.

To display the weather data in the component template, you can use Vue's template syntax to interpolate the data.


```vue
<div>
 <input v-model="location" placeholder="Enter a location">
 <button @click="fetchWeather">Get weather</button>
</div>
<div v-if="weather">
 <h2>Current weather for {{ location }}</h2>
 <p>{{ weather.weather[0].description }}</p>
 <p>Temperature: {{ Math.round(weather.main.temp - 273.15) }}&deg;C</p>
 <p>Humidity: {{ weather.main.humidity }}%</p>
</div>
```
In this example, the `v-if` directive is used to conditionally render the weather data once it has been fetched.


To create a form to enter a location, you can start by creating a data property for the location value and binding it to an input field in the template.


```vue
<template>
 <div>
 <form @submit.prevent="fetchWeather">
 <label for="location">Location:</label>
 <input id="location" v-model="location" type="text" required>
 <button type="submit">Get weather</button>
 </form>
 </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
 data() {
 return {
 location: '',
 };
 },
 methods: {
 fetchWeather() {
 // code to fetch weather data
 },
 },
};
</script>
```
In this example, the `location` data property is bound to the `v-model` directive on the input field, which allows the user to enter a location. The `@submit.prevent` directive is used to prevent the form from submitting automatically and to call the `fetchWeather` method when the user submits the form.

Once the user submits the form, the `fetchWeather` method will be called, and you can use the `location` data property to fetch weather data for the entered location from an API (as shown in the previous example).


To display the current weather conditions, you can use the weather data fetched from the API and interpolate it in the component template using Vue's template syntax.

Here's an example of how you could display the current weather conditions:


```vue
<template>
 <div>
 <form @submit.prevent="fetchWeather">
 <label for="location">Location:</label>
 <input id="location" v-model="location" type="text" required>
 <button type="submit">Get weather</button>
 </form>
 <div v-if="weather">
 <h2>Current Weather in {{ location }}</h2>
 <p>{{ weather.weather[0].description }}</p>
 <p>Temperature: {{ weather.main.temp }}&deg;F</p>
 <p>Feels Like: {{ weather.main.feels_like }}&deg;F</p>
 <p>Humidity: {{ weather.main.humidity }}%</p>
 <p>Wind Speed: {{ weather.wind.speed }} mph</p>
 </div>
 </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
 data() {
 return {
 location: '',
 weather: null,
 };
 },
 methods: {
 async fetchWeather() {
 // code to fetch weather data
 },
 },
};
</script>
```
In this example, the `v-if` directive is used to conditionally render the weather data only when it exists (i.e., after the API call has successfully completed). The `weather` object contains various properties related to the current weather conditions, such as `weather.description`, `main.temp`, `main.feels_like`, `main.humidity`, and `wind.speed`. These properties can be interpolated in the template using Vue's template syntax to display the current weather conditions to the user.


To add a forecast for the next few days, you can modify the code that fetches weather data from the API to fetch forecast data as well. One way to do this is to use the OpenWeatherMap API, which provides a `forecast` endpoint that returns weather forecast data for the next several days.

Here's an example of how you could modify the `fetchWeather` method to fetch both the current weather conditions and a forecast for the next few days:


```vue
<template>
 <div>
 <form @submit.prevent="fetchWeather">
 <label for="location">Location:</label>
 <input id="location" v-model="location" type="text" required>
 <button type="submit">Get weather</button>
 </form>
 <div v-if="weather">
 <h2>Current Weather in {{ location }}</h2>
 <p>{{ weather.weather[0].description }}</p>
 <p>Temperature: {{ weather.main.temp }}&deg;F</p>
 <p>Feels Like: {{ weather.main.feels_like }}&deg;F</p>
 <p>Humidity: {{ weather.main.humidity }}%</p>
 <p>Wind Speed: {{ weather.wind.speed }} mph</p>
 <h2>Weather Forecast for {{ location }}</h2>
 <ul>
 <li v-for="forecast in forecasts" :key="forecast.dt">
 <p>Date: {{ forecast.dt_txt }}</p>
 <p>Temperature: {{ forecast.main.temp }}&deg;F</p>
 <p>Feels Like: {{ forecast.main.feels_like }}&deg;F</p>
 <p>Humidity: {{ forecast.main.humidity }}%</p>
 <p>Wind Speed: {{ forecast.wind.speed }} mph</p>
 <p>Description: {{ forecast.weather[0].description }}</p>
 </li>
 </ul>
 </div>
 </div>
</template>

<script>
import axios from 'axios';

export default {
 data() {
 return {
 location: '',
 weather: null,
 forecasts: [],
 };
 },
 methods: {
 async fetchWeather() {
 const apiKey = 'your-api-key';
 const weatherUrl = `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${this.location}&appid=${apiKey}&units=imperial`;
 const forecastUrl = `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q=${this.location}&appid=${apiKey}&units=imperial`;
 try {
 const [weatherResponse, forecastResponse] = await Promise.all([
 axios.get(weatherUrl),
 axios.get(forecastUrl),
 ]);
 this.weather = weatherResponse.data;
 this.forecasts = forecastResponse.data.list.filter((forecast) =>
 forecast.dt_txt.includes('12:00:00')
 );
 } catch (error) {
 console.error(error);
 }
 },
 },
};
</script>
```
In this example, the `fetchWeather` method uses `Promise.all` to make parallel requests to fetch both the current weather data and the forecast data. The response from the `forecast` endpoint returns an array of forecast objects, where each object represents weather data for a specific date and time. To display the forecast for the next few days, we filter the forecast data to include only objects where the `dt_txt` property includes `12:00:00`. This will give us one forecast per day for the next several days.

In the template, we iterate over the `forecasts` array using a `v-for` directive to display the forecast data for each day. Each forecast object contains various


To style the app with CSS, you can add a `<style>` block to your Vue component file and define styles for the various elements in your template.

Here's an example of how you could add some basic styles to your weather app:


```vue
<template>
 <div class="weather-app">
 <form @submit.prevent="fetchWeather">
 <label for="location">Location:</label>
 <input id="location" v-model="location" type="text" required>
 <button type="submit">Get weather</button>
 </form>
 <div v-if="weather" class="weather-current">
 <h2>Current Weather in {{ location }}</h2>
 <p>{{ weather.weather[0].description }}</p>
 <p>Temperature: {{ weather.main.temp }}&deg;F</p>
 <p>Feels Like: {{ weather.main.feels_like }}&deg;F</p>
 <p>Humidity: {{ weather.main.humidity }}%</p>
 <p>Wind Speed: {{ weather.wind.speed }} mph</p>
 </div>
 <div v-if="forecasts.length" class="weather-forecast">
 <h2>Weather Forecast for {{ location }}</h2>
 <ul>
 <li v-for="forecast in forecasts" :key="forecast.dt" class="weather-forecast-item">
 <p>Date: {{ forecast.dt_txt }}</p>
 <p>Temperature: {{ forecast.main.temp }}&deg;F</p>
 <p>Feels Like: {{ forecast.main.feels_like }}&deg;F</p>
 <p>Humidity: {{ forecast.main.humidity }}%</p>
 <p>Wind Speed: {{ forecast.wind.speed }} mph</p>
 <p>Description: {{ forecast.weather[0].description }}</p>
 </li>
 </ul>
 </div>
 </div>
</template>

<script>
import axios from 'axios';

export default {
 data() {
 return {
 location: '',
 weather: null,
 forecasts: [],
 };
 },
 methods: {
 async fetchWeather() {
 const apiKey = 'your-api-key';
 const weatherUrl = `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${this.location}&appid=${apiKey}&units=imperial`;
 const forecastUrl = `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q=${this.location}&appid=${apiKey}&units=imperial`;
 try {
 const [weatherResponse, forecastResponse] = await Promise.all([
 axios.get(weatherUrl),
 axios.get(forecastUrl),
 ]);
 this.weather = weatherResponse.data;
 this.forecasts = forecastResponse.data.list.filter((forecast) =>
 forecast.dt_txt.includes('12:00:00')
 );
 } catch (error) {
 console.error(error);
 }
 },
 },
};
<style>
.weather-app {
 font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;
 max-width: 500px;
 margin: 0 auto;
 text-align: center;
}

form {

}

button {
 font-size: 16px;
 padding:
```

# Chapter 4: Building a GitHub User Search App
To use the GitHub API to search for users, you can make an HTTP GET request to the `https://api.github.com/search/users` endpoint with the `q` query parameter set to the search term.

Here's an example of how you could create a Vue component that allows users to search for GitHub users:


```vue
<template>
 <div class="user-search">
 <form @submit.prevent="searchUsers">
 <label for="search">Search GitHub Users:</label>
 <input id="search" v-model="searchTerm" type="text" required>
 <button type="submit">Search</button>
 </form>
 <ul v-if="users.length">
 <li v-for="user in users" :key="user.id">
 <a :href="user.html_url" target="_blank">{{ user.login }}</a>
 </li>
 </ul>
 <p v-else>No users found.</p>
 </div>
</template>

<script>
import axios from 'axios';

export default {
 data() {
 return {
 searchTerm: '',
 users: [],
 };
 },
 methods: {
 async searchUsers() {
 const url = `https://api.github.com/search/users?q=${this.searchTerm}`;
 try {
 const response = await axios.get(url);
 this.users = response.data.items;
 } catch (error) {
 console.error(error);
 }
 },
 },
};
</script>

<style>
.user-search {
 font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;
 max-width: 500px;
 margin: 0 auto;
 text-align: center;
}

form {
 display: flex;
 flex-direction: column;
 align-items: center;
 margin-bottom: 20px;
}

label {
 font-size: 18px;
 margin-bottom: 10px;
}

input {
 font-size: 16px;
 padding: 10px;
 border: none;
 border-radius: 4px;
 box-shadow: 0 0 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}

button {
 font-size: 16px;
 padding: 10px;
 background-color: #007bff;
 color: #fff;
 border: none;
 border-radius: 4px;
 box-shadow: 0 0 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
 cursor: pointer;
}

ul {
 list-style: none;
 padding: 0;
}

li {
 margin: 10px 0;
}

a {
 font-size: 16px;
 text-decoration: none;
 color: #007bff;
}
</style>
```
In this example, the `searchTerm` data property is bound to the search input field using `v-model`. When the form is submitted, the `searchUsers` method makes an HTTP GET request to the GitHub API with the search term, and sets the `users` data property to the array of user objects returned by the API.

The results are displayed in an unordered list using `v-for` to loop over the `users` array, and each user's login name is displayed as a link to their GitHub profile using an anchor tag with the `href` attribute set to the user's `html_url` property. If no users are found, a message is displayed indicating this.

The CSS styles are applied using a `<style>` block within the Vue component file.


To display user profiles and repositories, you can make use of the GitHub API to fetch user information and repositories. You can make HTTP GET requests to the following endpoints:

* `https://api.github.com/users/{username}` to get information about a specific GitHub user.
* `https://api.github.com/users/{username}/repos` to get a list of repositories for a specific GitHub user.

Here's an example of how you could create a Vue component that displays a user profile and their repositories:


```vue
<template>
 <div class="user-profile">
 <div v-if="user">
 <h2>{{ user.name }}</h2>
 <img :src="user.avatar_url" :alt="`${user.name} avatar`">
 <p>{{ user.bio }}</p>
 <p>Followers: {{ user.followers }}</p>
 <p>Following: {{ user.following }}</p>
 </div>
 <div v-else>
 <p>Loading...</p>
 </div>
 <hr>
 <h3 v-if="repos.length">{{ user.name }}'s Repositories:</h3>
 <ul v-if="repos.length">
 <li v-for="repo in repos" :key="repo.id">
 <a :href="repo.html_url" target="_blank">{{ repo.name }}</a>
 <p>{{ repo.description }}</p>
 </li>
 </ul>
 <p v-else>No repositories found.</p>
 </div>
</template>

<script>
import axios from 'axios';

export default {
 data() {
 return {
 user: null,
 repos: [],
 };
 },
 async created() {
 await this.fetchUser();
 await this.fetchRepositories();
 },
 methods: {
 async fetchUser() {
 const url = `https://api.github.com/users/${this.$route.params.username}`;
 try {
 const response = await axios.get(url);
 this.user = response.data;
 } catch (error) {
 console.error(error);
 }
 },
 async fetchRepositories() {
 const url = `https://api.github.com/users/${this.$route.params.username}/repos`;
 try {
 const response = await axios.get(url);
 this.repos = response.data;
 } catch (error) {
 console.error(error);
 }
 },
 },
};
</script>

<style>
.user-profile {
 font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;
 max-width: 800px;
 margin: 0 auto;
 text-align: center;
}

img {
 max-width: 150px;
 border-radius: 50%;
 margin: 20px 0;
}

ul {
 list-style: none;
 padding: 0;
}

li {
 margin: 20px 0;
}

a {
 font-size: 24px;
 text-decoration: none;
 color: #007bff;
}

p {
 font-size: 18px;
}
</style>
```
In this example, the component uses the `$route.params` property to get the username from the URL. When the component is created, the `fetchUser` and `fetchRepositories` methods are called to fetch the user data and repositories data respectively using the GitHub API.

The user's name, bio, and follower/following counts are displayed along with their profile picture using data binding. The list of repositories is displayed using `v-for` to loop over the `repos` array, and each repository's name and description are displayed using an anchor tag with the `href` attribute set to the repository's `html_url` property. If no repositories are found, a message is displayed indicating


To add pagination to the search results, you can make use of the `page` and `per_page` parameters in the GitHub API. The `page` parameter is used to specify which page of search results to return, and the `per_page` parameter is used to specify how many results to return per page.

Here's an example of how you could create a Vue component that displays a paginated list of search results from the GitHub API:


```vue
<template>
 <div class="search-results">
 <form @submit.prevent="searchUsers">
 <input type="text" v-model="query" placeholder="Search GitHub users...">
 <button type="submit">Search</button>
 </form>
 <ul>
 <li v-for="user in users" :key="user.id">
 <img :src="user.avatar_url" :alt="`${user.login} avatar`">
 <a :href="user.html_url" target="_blank">{{ user.login }}</a>
 </li>
 </ul>
 <nav v-if="pages.length > 1">
 <ul>
 <li v-for="page in pages" :key="page">
 <a :class="{ active: currentPage === page }" @click.prevent="goToPage(page)" href="#">{{ page }}</a>
 </li>
 </ul>
 </nav>
 </div>
</template>

<script>
import axios from 'axios';

export default {
 data() {
 return {
 query: '',
 users: [],
 currentPage: 1,
 perPage: 10,
 };
 },
 computed: {
 pages() {
 const pagesCount = Math.ceil(this.totalCount / this.perPage);
 return Array.from({ length: pagesCount }, (_, i) => i + 1);
 },
 totalCount() {
 return this.users.length > 0 ? this.users[0].total_count : 0;
 },
 },
 methods: {
 async searchUsers() {
 const url = `https://api.github.com/search/users?q=${this.query}&page=${this.currentPage}&per_page=${this.perPage}`;
 try {
 const response = await axios.get(url);
 this.users = response.data.items;
 } catch (error) {
 console.error(error);
 }
 },
 goToPage(page) {
 this.currentPage = page;
 this.searchUsers();
 },
 },
};
</script>

<style>
.search-results {
 font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;
 max-width: 800px;
 margin: 0 auto;
 text-align: center;
}

form {
 margin: 20px 0;
}

input[type="text"] {
 padding: 10px;
 font-size: 18px;
 border: none;
 border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;
}

button[type="submit"] {
 padding: 10px;
 font-size: 18px;
 background-color: #007bff;
 color: #fff;
 border: none;
 cursor: pointer;
}

button[type="submit"]:hover {
 background-color: #0062cc;
}

ul {
 list-style: none;
 padding: 0;
}

li {
 margin: 20px 0;
}

img {
 max-width: 150px;
 border-radius: 50%;
 margin: 20px 0;
}

a {
 font-size: 24px;
 text-decoration: none;
 color: #007bff;
}

a.active {
 font-weight: bold;
}
</style>
```
In this example, the component uses a form to allow the user to search for


To style the app with Bootstrap, you can include the Bootstrap CSS file in your HTML file and add Bootstrap classes to your Vue templates.

Here's an example of how you could modify the previous Vue component to use Bootstrap:


```vue
<template>
 <div class="container">
 <div class="row">
 <div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2">
 <form @submit.prevent="searchUsers" class="mt-5">
 <div class="form-group">
 <input type="text" v-model="query" class="form-control form-control-lg" placeholder="Search GitHub users...">
 </div>
 <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Search</button>
 </form>
 <ul class="list-group mt-5">
 <li v-for="user in users" :key="user.id" class="list-group-item">
 <img :src="user.avatar_url" :alt="`${user.login} avatar`" class="rounded-circle mr-3">
 <a :href="user.html_url" target="_blank">{{ user.login }}</a>
 </li>
 </ul>
 <nav v-if="pages.length > 1" class="mt-5">

# Chapter 5: Building a Quiz App
To create a quiz with multiple choice questions, you can define an array of questions in your Vue component's data object, with each question object containing a question text and an array of possible answers. You can then create a template that displays each question and its possible answers as radio buttons, and a button to submit the user's answers. When the user submits their answers, you can compare them to the correct answers and display the user's score.

Here's an example of how you could create a quiz with three multiple choice questions:


```vue
<template>
 <div class="container">
 <h1>Quiz</h1>
 <div v-if="!submitted">
 <form @submit.prevent="submitQuiz">
 <div v-for="(question, index) in questions" :key="index">
 <h4>{{ question.text }}</h4>
 <div>
 <label v-for="(answer, answerIndex) in question.answers" :key="answerIndex">
 <input type="radio" :name="`question-${index}`" :value="answerIndex" v-model="userAnswers[index]">
 {{ answer }}
 </label>
 </div>
 </div>
 <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
 </form>
 </div>
 <div v-else>
 <h2>Your score: {{ score }}/{{ questions.length }}</h2>
 <ul>
 <li v-for="(question, index) in questions" :key="index">
 {{ question.text }} - Your answer: {{ question.answers[userAnswers[index]] }}, Correct answer: {{ question.answers[question.correctAnswer] }}
 </li>
 </ul>
 </div>
 </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
 data() {
 return {
 questions: [
 {
 text: 'What is the capital of France?',
 answers: ['Paris', 'London', 'Berlin', 'Madrid'],
 correctAnswer: 0,
 },
 {
 text: 'What is the largest planet in our solar system?',
 answers: ['Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Mars', 'Neptune'],
 correctAnswer: 0,
 },
 {
 text: 'Who painted the Mona Lisa?',
 answers: ['Leonardo da Vinci', 'Pablo Picasso', 'Vincent van Gogh', 'Claude Monet'],
 correctAnswer: 0,
 },
 ],
 userAnswers: [],
 submitted: false,
 };
 },
 computed: {
 score() {
 return this.userAnswers.filter((answer, index) => answer === this.questions[index].correctAnswer).length;
 },
 },
 methods: {
 submitQuiz() {
 this.submitted = true;
 },
 },
};
</script>

<style>
body {
 font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;
}
</style>
```
In this example, each question object contains a `text` property for the question text, an `answers` array for the possible answers, and a `correctAnswer` index for the correct answer. In the template, we use `v-for` to display each question and its possible answers as radio buttons. When the user submits their answers, we set the `submitted` data property to `true`, which triggers the display of the user's score and their answers. The `score` computed property compares the user's answers to the correct answers and returns the number of correct answers.


To display the questions and choices in the quiz, you can use a `v-for` directive to loop through each question and its choices, and display them in the template. Here's an updated example of the Vue component that includes the questions and choices:


```vue
<template>
 <div class="container">
 <h1>Quiz</h1>
 <div v-if="!submitted">
 <form @submit.prevent="submitQuiz">
 <div v-for="(question, index) in questions" :key="index">
 <h4>{{ question.text }}</h4>
 <div>
 <label v-for="(choice, choiceIndex) in question.choices" :key="choiceIndex">
 <input type="radio" :name="`question-${index}`" :value="choiceIndex" v-model="userAnswers[index]">
 {{ choice }}
 </label>
 </div>
 </div>
 <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
 </form>
 </div>
 <div v-else>
 <h2>Your score: {{ score }}/{{ questions.length }}</h2>
 <ul>
 <li v-for="(question, index) in questions" :key="index">
 {{ question.text }} - Your answer: {{ question.choices[userAnswers[index]] }}, Correct answer: {{ question.choices[question.answerIndex] }}
 </li>
 </ul>
 </div>
 </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
 data() {
 return {
 questions: [
 {
 text: 'What is the capital of France?',
 choices: ['Paris', 'London', 'Berlin', 'Madrid'],
 answerIndex: 0,
 },
 {
 text: 'What is the largest planet in our solar system?',
 choices: ['Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Mars', 'Neptune'],
 answerIndex: 0,
 },
 {
 text: 'Who painted the Mona Lisa?',
 choices: ['Leonardo da Vinci', 'Pablo Picasso', 'Vincent van Gogh', 'Claude Monet'],
 answerIndex: 0,
 },
 ],
 userAnswers: [],
 submitted: false,
 };
 },
 computed: {
 score() {
 return this.userAnswers.filter((answer, index) => answer === this.questions[index].answerIndex).length;
 },
 },
 methods: {
 submitQuiz() {
 this.submitted = true;
 },
 },
};
</script>

<style>
body {
 font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;
}
</style>
```
In this example, we use `v-for` to loop through each question in the `questions` array and display its `text` property as a heading. We then loop through each choice in the `choices` array for the question and display it as a radio button with its corresponding `value` set to its index. The `v-model` directive binds the user's choice to the `userAnswers` array using the current index in the `v-for` loop.

After the user submits their answers, we loop through each question again and display the question text, the user's answer, and the correct answer for each question. We use the `score` computed property to count the number of correct answers and display it to the user.


To keep track of the user's score, you can add a `score` property to the component's `data` object and initialize it to `0`. Then, in the `submitQuiz` method, you can loop through the user's answers and compare them to the correct answers. For each correct answer, you can increment the `score` property. Finally, you can set the `submitted` property to `true` to show the user their score.

Here's an example of how you can update the component to keep track of the user's score:


```vue
<template>
 <div class="container">
 <h1>Quiz</h1>
 <div v-if="!submitted">
 <form @submit.prevent="submitQuiz">
 <div v-for="(question, index) in questions" :key="index">
 <h4>{{ question.text }}</h4>
 <div>
 <label v-for="(choice, choiceIndex) in question.choices" :key="choiceIndex">
 <input type="radio" :name="`question-${index}`" :value="choiceIndex" v-model="userAnswers[index]">
 {{ choice }}
 </label>
 </div>
 </div>
 <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
 </form>
 </div>
 <div v-else>
 <h2>Your score: {{ score }}/{{ questions.length }}</h2>
 <ul>
 <li v-for="(question, index) in questions" :key="index">
 {{ question.text }} - Your answer: {{ question.choices[userAnswers[index]] }}, Correct answer: {{ question.choices[question.answerIndex] }}
 </li>
 </ul>
 </div>
 </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
 data() {
 return {
 questions: [
 {
 text: 'What is the capital of France?',
 choices: ['Paris', 'London', 'Berlin', 'Madrid'],
 answerIndex: 0,
 },
 {
 text: 'What is the largest planet in our solar system?',
 choices: ['Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Mars', 'Neptune'],
 answerIndex: 0,
 },
 {
 text: 'Who painted the Mona Lisa?',
 choices: ['Leonardo da Vinci', 'Pablo Picasso', 'Vincent van Gogh', 'Claude Monet'],
 answerIndex: 0,
 },
 ],
 userAnswers: [],
 score: 0,
 submitted: false,
 };
 },
 computed: {
 percentScore() {
 return Math.round(this.score / this.questions.length \* 100);
 },
 },
 methods: {
 submitQuiz() {
 this.score = 0;
 for (let i = 0; i < this.questions.length; i++) {
 if (this.userAnswers[i] === this.questions[i].answerIndex) {
 this.score++;
 }
 }
 this.submitted = true;
 },
 },
};
</script>

<style>
body {
 font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;
}
</style>
```
In this example, we add a `score` property to the component's `data` object and initialize it to `0`. In the `submitQuiz` method, we reset the `score` property to `0` and loop through the questions. For each question, we compare the user's answer to the correct answer and increment the `score` property if the answers match. Finally, we set the `submitted` property to `true` to show the user their score.

We also add a computed property


To display the user's final score after they submit the quiz, you can update the `submitQuiz` method to set a `showScore` property to `true`. Then, you can use a conditional statement in the template to display the user's score only if `showScore` is `true`.

Here's an example of how you can update the component to display the user's final score:


```vue
<template>
 <div class="container">
 <h1>Quiz</h1>
 <div v-if="!submitted">
 <form @submit.prevent="submitQuiz">
 <div v-for="(question, index) in questions" :key="index">
 <h4>{{ question.text }}</h4>
 <div>
 <label v-for="(choice, choiceIndex) in question.choices" :key="choiceIndex">
 <input type="radio" :name="`question-${index}`" :value="choiceIndex" v-model="userAnswers[index]">
 {{ choice }}
 </label>
 </div>
 </div>
 <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
 </form>
 </div>
 <div v-else>
 <h2 v-if="showScore">Your score: {{ score }}/{{ questions.length }}</h2>
 <ul>
 <li v-for="(question, index) in questions" :key="index">
 {{ question.text }} - Your answer: {{ question.choices[userAnswers[index]] }}, Correct answer: {{ question.choices[question.answerIndex] }}
 </li>
 </ul>
 </div>
 </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
 data() {
 return {
 questions: [
 {
 text: 'What is the capital of France?',
 choices: ['Paris', 'London', 'Berlin', 'Madrid'],
 answerIndex: 0,
 },
 {
 text: 'What is the largest planet in our solar system?',
 choices: ['Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Mars', 'Neptune'],
 answerIndex: 0,
 },
 {
 text: 'Who painted the Mona Lisa?',
 choices: ['Leonardo da Vinci', 'Pablo Picasso', 'Vincent van Gogh', 'Claude Monet'],
 answerIndex: 0,
 },
 ],
 userAnswers: [],
 score: 0,
 submitted: false,
 showScore: false,
 };
 },
 computed: {
 percentScore() {
 return Math.round(this.score / this.questions.length \* 100);
 },
 },
 methods: {
 submitQuiz() {
 this.score = 0;
 for (let i = 0; i < this.questions.length; i++) {
 if (this.userAnswers[i] === this.questions[i].answerIndex) {
 this.score++;
 }
 }
 this.showScore = true;
 this.submitted = true;
 },
 },
};
</script>

<style>
body {
 font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;
}
</style>
```
In this example, we add a `showScore` property to the component's `data` object and initialize it to `false`. In the `submitQuiz` method, we set `showScore` to `true` after we calculate the user's score. Then, in the template, we use a conditional statement to display the user's score only if `showScore` is `true`.

With these changes, the user's final score will be displayed after they submit the quiz.


To add the ability to restart the quiz after the user has completed it, you can add a button that calls a `resetQuiz` method to reset the `submitted`, `userAnswers`, `score`, and `showScore` properties to their initial values. You can also add a `v-if` directive to the submit button to hide it when the quiz has been submitted and the score is being displayed.

Here's an example of how you can update the component to allow the user to restart the quiz:


```vue
<template>
 <div class="container">
 <h1>Quiz</h1>
 <div v-if="!submitted">
 <form @submit.prevent="submitQuiz">
 <div v-for="(question, index) in questions" :key="index">
 <h4>{{ question.text }}</h4>
 <div>
 <label v-for="(choice, choiceIndex) in question.choices" :key="choiceIndex">
 <input type="radio" :name="`question-${index}`" :value="choiceIndex" v-model="userAnswers[index]">
 {{ choice }}
 </label>
 </div>
 </div>
 <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary" v-if="!showScore">Submit</button>
 </form>
 </div>
 <div v-else>
 <h2 v-if="showScore">Your score: {{ score }}/{{ questions.length }}</h2>
 <ul>
 <li v-for="(question, index) in questions" :key="index">
 {{ question.text }} - Your answer: {{ question.choices[userAnswers[index]] }}, Correct answer: {{ question.choices[question.answerIndex] }}
 </li>
 </ul>
 <button class="btn btn-secondary" @click="resetQuiz">Restart Quiz</button>
 </div>
 </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
 data() {
 return {
 questions: [
 {
 text: 'What is the capital of France?',
 choices: ['Paris', 'London', 'Berlin', 'Madrid'],
 answerIndex: 0,
 },
 {
 text: 'What is the largest planet in our solar system?',
 choices: ['Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Mars', 'Neptune'],
 answerIndex: 0,
 },
 {
 text: 'Who painted the Mona Lisa?',
 choices: ['Leonardo da Vinci', 'Pablo Picasso', 'Vincent van Gogh', 'Claude Monet'],
 answerIndex: 0,
 },
 ],
 userAnswers: [],
 score: 0,
 submitted: false,
 showScore: false,
 };
 },
 computed: {
 percentScore() {
 return Math.round(this.score / this.questions.length \* 100);
 },
 },
 methods: {
 submitQuiz() {
 this.score = 0;
 for (let i = 0; i < this.questions.length; i++) {
 if (this.userAnswers[i] === this.questions[i].answerIndex) {
 this.score++;
 }
 }
 this.showScore = true;
 this.submitted = true;
 },
 resetQuiz() {
 this.userAnswers = [];
 this.score = 0;
 this.submitted = false;
 this.showScore = false;
 },
 },
};
</script>

<style>
body {
 font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;
}
</style>
```
In this example, we add a `resetQuiz` method that sets the `userAnswers`, `score`, `submitted`, and `showScore` properties back to their


# Chapter 6: Building a Chat Application
To create a chat room using Firebase, you can follow these general steps:

1. Set up a Firebase project in the Firebase console.
2. Create a new Firebase Realtime Database in the Firebase console.
3. Install the Firebase SDK for JavaScript in your project.
4. Create a Vue.js component for the chat room that connects to the Firebase Realtime Database.
5. Implement the ability to send messages to the chat room and display them in the UI.
6. Implement the ability to see which users are currently online in the chat room.
7. Implement the ability to display a message when a user joins or leaves the chat room.

Here's an example of how you can create a basic chat room component using Firebase:


```vue
<template>
 <div class="container">
 <h1>Chat Room</h1>
 <div class="chat-messages">
 <div v-for="(message, index) in messages" :key="index">
 <strong>{{ message.sender }}:</strong> {{ message.text }}
 </div>
 </div>
 <form @submit.prevent="sendMessage">
 <div class="form-group">
 <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Message" v-model="newMessage">
 </div>
 <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Send</button>
 </form>
 <div class="chat-users">
 <h3>Online Users</h3>
 <ul>
 <li v-for="(user, index) in users" :key="index">
 {{ user.name }}
 </li>
 </ul>
 </div>
 </div>
</template>

<script>
import firebase from 'firebase/app';
import 'firebase/database';

export default {
 data() {
 return {
 messages: [],
 newMessage: '',
 users: [],
 };
 },
 created() {
 const db = firebase.database().ref('messages');
 db.on('child_added', snapshot => {
 const message = snapshot.val();
 this.messages.push(message);
 });

 const connectedRef = firebase.database().ref('.info/connected');
 connectedRef.on('value', snapshot => {
 if (snapshot.val()) {
 const userRef = firebase.database().ref('users').push();
 userRef.set({
 name: this.user.name,
 });
 userRef.onDisconnect().remove();
 }
 });

 const usersRef = firebase.database().ref('users');
 usersRef.on('value', snapshot => {
 const users = snapshot.val();
 this.users = Object.values(users);
 });
 },
 methods: {
 sendMessage() {
 const db = firebase.database().ref('messages').push();
 db.set({
 sender: this.user.name,
 text: this.newMessage,
 });
 this.newMessage = '';
 },
 },
 mounted() {
 this.user = {
 name: prompt('Please enter your name'),
 };
 },
};
</script>

<style>
body {
 font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;
}
.chat-messages {
 height: 300px;
 overflow: scroll;
}
.chat-users {
 position: absolute;
 top: 0;
 right: 0;
 width: 200px;
 background-color: #f5f5f5;
 padding: 10px;
 border: 1px solid #ddd;
 height: 100%;
 box-shadow: -5px 0 5px -5px #333;
}
</style>
```
In this example, we use the Firebase Realtime Database to store messages and users in the chat room. We also use the Firebase SDK to listen for changes to the


To allow users to sign in with Google or Facebook in your Vue.js app, you can use Firebase Authentication. Firebase Authentication provides a simple way to authenticate users with their Google or Facebook accounts.

Here are the general steps to set up Firebase Authentication for your Vue.js app:

1. Set up a Firebase project in the Firebase console.
2. Enable Google and/or Facebook authentication in the Firebase Authentication section of the Firebase console.
3. Install the Firebase SDK for JavaScript in your project.
4. Create a Vue.js component for the login page that uses the Firebase Authentication SDK to sign in with Google or Facebook.
5. Implement the ability to redirect the user to the home page after they have successfully logged in.

Here's an example of how you can create a login component that allows users to sign in with Google or Facebook:


```vue
<template>
 <div class="container">
 <h1>Login</h1>
 <button @click="signInWithGoogle" class="btn btn-primary">Sign in with Google</button>
 <button @click="signInWithFacebook" class="btn btn-primary">Sign in with Facebook</button>
 </div>
</template>

<script>
import firebase from 'firebase/app';
import 'firebase/auth';

export default {
 methods: {
 signInWithGoogle() {
 const provider = new firebase.auth.GoogleAuthProvider();
 firebase.auth().signInWithPopup(provider)
 .then(() => {
 this.$router.push('/');
 })
 .catch(error => {
 console.error(error);
 });
 },
 signInWithFacebook() {
 const provider = new firebase.auth.FacebookAuthProvider();
 firebase.auth().signInWithPopup(provider)
 .then(() => {
 this.$router.push('/');
 })
 .catch(error => {
 console.error(error);
 });
 },
 },
};
</script>
```
In this example, we use the Firebase Authentication SDK to sign in with Google or Facebook. When the user clicks on the "Sign in with Google" or "Sign in with Facebook" buttons, we call the `signInWithPopup` method to show a pop-up window where the user can sign in. Once the user has successfully logged in, we use the Vue.js router to redirect the user to the home page. If there is an error during the login process, we log the error to the console.


To send and receive messages in real-time in your Vue.js chat room app using Firebase, you can use Firebase Realtime Database or Cloud Firestore. Firebase Realtime Database is a NoSQL cloud-hosted database that stores and syncs data in real-time, while Cloud Firestore is a more advanced and scalable NoSQL cloud-hosted database that also stores and syncs data in real-time.

Here are the general steps to set up Firebase Realtime Database or Cloud Firestore for your Vue.js chat room app:

1. Set up a Firebase project in the Firebase console.
2. Enable Firebase Realtime Database or Cloud Firestore in the Firebase console.
3. Install the Firebase SDK for JavaScript in your project.
4. Create a Vue.js component for the chat room that listens for new messages from Firebase Realtime Database or Cloud Firestore and displays them to the user.
5. Implement the ability for the user to send a message to Firebase Realtime Database or Cloud Firestore.

Here's an example of how you can create a chat room component that sends and receives messages in real-time using Firebase Realtime Database:


```vue
<template>
 <div class="container">
 <h1>Chat Room</h1>
 <div v-for="(message, index) in messages" :key="index">
 <p>{{ message.user }}: {{ message.content }}</p>
 </div>
 <form @submit.prevent="sendMessage">
 <input type="text" v-model="newMessage" />
 <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Send</button>
 </form>
 </div>
</template>

<script>
import firebase from 'firebase/app';
import 'firebase/database';

export default {
 data() {
 return {
 messages: [],
 newMessage: '',
 };
 },
 created() {
 const messagesRef = firebase.database().ref('messages');
 messagesRef.on('child_added', snapshot => {
 const message = snapshot.val();
 this.messages.push(message);
 });
 },
 methods: {
 sendMessage() {
 const user = firebase.auth().currentUser;
 const messagesRef = firebase.database().ref('messages');
 const newMessageRef = messagesRef.push();
 newMessageRef.set({
 user: user.displayName,
 content: this.newMessage,
 });
 this.newMessage = '';
 },
 },
};
</script>
```
In this example, we listen for new messages from Firebase Realtime Database by calling the `on` method on the `messagesRef` database reference. Whenever a new child is added to the `messages` node in the database, the `child_added` event is triggered and we push the new message to the `messages` array in our Vue.js component.

To send a new message, we use the `push` method on the `messagesRef` database reference to create a new child node under the `messages` node, and then we use the `set` method on the new child node to set the user and content of the message. We also clear the `newMessage` input field after the message has been sent.

This is just one example of how you can implement real-time messaging in your Vue.js chat room app using Firebase. Depending on your app's requirements, you may need to customize this implementation or use Cloud Firestore instead of Firebase Realtime Database.


To add the ability to delete messages in your Vue.js chat room app using Firebase, you can add a "delete" button next to each message in the chat room component that, when clicked, deletes the message from the Firebase Realtime Database or Cloud Firestore.

Here's an example of how you can add a "delete" button to the chat room component and delete messages from Firebase Realtime Database:


```vue
<template>
 <div class="container">
 <h1>Chat Room</h1>
 <div v-for="(message, index) in messages" :key="index">
 <p>{{ message.user }}: {{ message.content }}</p>
 <button class="btn btn-danger" @click="deleteMessage(index)">Delete</button>
 </div>
 <form @submit.prevent="sendMessage">
 <input type="text" v-model="newMessage" />
 <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Send</button>
 </form>
 </div>
</template>

<script>
import firebase from 'firebase/app';
import 'firebase/database';

export default {
 data() {
 return {
 messages: [],
 newMessage: '',
 };
 },
 created() {
 const messagesRef = firebase.database().ref('messages');
 messagesRef.on('child_added', snapshot => {
 const message = snapshot.val();
 message.id = snapshot.key;
 this.messages.push(message);
 });
 messagesRef.on('child_removed', snapshot => {
 const deletedMessage = snapshot.val();
 deletedMessage.id = snapshot.key;
 const index = this.messages.findIndex(message => message.id === deletedMessage.id);
 if (index !== -1) {
 this.messages.splice(index, 1);
 }
 });
 },
 methods: {
 sendMessage() {
 const user = firebase.auth().currentUser;
 const messagesRef = firebase.database().ref('messages');
 const newMessageRef = messagesRef.push();
 newMessageRef.set({
 user: user.displayName,
 content: this.newMessage,
 });
 this.newMessage = '';
 },
 deleteMessage(index) {
 const message = this.messages[index];
 const messagesRef = firebase.database().ref('messages');
 messagesRef.child(message.id).remove();
 },
 },
};
</script>
```
In this example, we add a "delete" button to each message in the `v-for` loop, and we bind the `click` event to the `deleteMessage` method in our Vue.js component. When the button is clicked, we pass the index of the message to the `deleteMessage` method.

In the `deleteMessage` method, we first retrieve the message from the `messages` array using the index, and then we use the `remove` method on the message's database reference to delete the message from Firebase Realtime Database. We also listen for the `child_removed` event on the `messagesRef` database reference and remove the deleted message from the `messages` array in our Vue.js component.

This is just one example of how you can implement message deletion in your Vue.js chat room app using Firebase. Depending on your app's requirements, you may need to customize this implementation or use Cloud Firestore instead of Firebase Realtime Database.


To style your Vue.js chat room app with CSS, you can use a variety of techniques, such as inline styles, external style sheets, or CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Bulma.

Here's an example of how you can use inline styles to style the chat room component:


```vue
<template>
 <div class="container">
 <h1 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Chat Room</h1>
 <div v-for="(message, index) in messages" :key="index" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
 <p style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0;">{{ message.user }}: {{ message.content }}</p>
 <button class="btn btn-danger" @click="deleteMessage(index)" style="margin-top: 5px;">Delete</button>
 </div>
 <form @submit.prevent="sendMessage" style="margin-top: 20px;">
 <input type="text" v-model="newMessage" style="padding: 5px; border: 1px solid #ccc; width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;" />
 <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary" style="padding: 5px 10px;">Send</button>
 </form>
 </div>
</template>
```
In this example, we use inline styles to set the font size, font weight, border, padding, and margin of the chat room title, message container, message text, and "delete" button. We also use inline styles to set the padding, border, width, and margin of the message input field and send button.

You can also use external style sheets to style your chat room app, as shown in this example:


```vue
<template>
 <div class="container">
 <h1 class="title">Chat Room</h1>
 <div v-for="(message, index) in messages" :key="index" class="message">
 <p class="text">{{ message.user }}: {{ message.content }}</p>
 <button class="delete-btn" @click="deleteMessage(index)">Delete</button>
 </div>
 <form @submit.prevent="sendMessage" class="message-form">
 <input type="text" v-model="newMessage" class="message-input" />
 <button type="submit" class="send-btn">Send</button>
 </form>
 </div>
</template>

<style scoped>
.container {
 max-width: 800px;
 margin: 0 auto;
}

.title {
 font-size: 24px;
 font-weight: bold;
 margin-bottom: 20px;
}

.message {
 border: 1px solid #ccc;
 padding: 10px;
 margin-bottom: 10px;
}

.text {
 font-size: 16px;
 margin: 0;
}

.delete-btn {
 margin-top: 5px;
 background-color: red;
 color: white;
 border: none;
 padding: 5px 10px;
 cursor: pointer;
}

.message-form {
 margin-top: 20px;
}

.message-input {
 padding: 5px;
 border: 1px solid #ccc;
 width: 100%;
 margin-bottom: 10px;
}

.send-btn {
 padding: 5px 10px;
 background-color: #007bff;
 color: white;
 border: none;
 cursor: pointer;
}
</style>
```
In this example, we use an external style sheet with the `scoped` property.



# Chapter 7: Building a Music Player App
To create a player interface with HTML and CSS, you can start by setting up the HTML structure for the player controls. You can use standard HTML tags such as `<div>`, `<button>`, and `<input>` to create the different elements of the player interface. Here's an example:


```vue
html`<div class="player">
 <button class="play-button"></button>
 <input type="range" class="progress-bar">
 <button class="volume-button"></button>
</div>
```
In the above example, we have a `<div>` element with a class of "player" that contains three child elements: a play button, a progress bar, and a volume button.

You can use CSS to style the different elements of the player interface. Here's an example of some basic CSS that can be used to style the player:


```vue
.player {
 display: flex;
 align-items: center;
}

.play-button,
.volume-button {
 background-color: transparent;
 border: none;
 height: 30px;
 width: 30px;
 margin: 0 10px;
 padding: 0;
 cursor: pointer;
 background-size: contain;
}

.play-button {
 background-image: url('play.svg');
}

.volume-button {
 background-image: url('volume.svg');
}

.progress-bar {
 width: 100%;
 height: 2px;
 margin: 0 10px;
 background-color: #ccc;
 appearance: none;
}

.progress-bar::-webkit-slider-thumb {
 appearance: none;
 height: 10px;
 width: 10px;
 background-color: #000;
 border-radius: 50%;
 margin-top: -4px;
}
```
In the above CSS, we're using flexbox to align the different elements of the player. We're also setting some basic styles for the play button, volume button, and progress bar.

Note that we're using background images for the play and volume buttons, and we're setting the `background-size` property to `contain` to ensure that the images scale proportionally.

For the progress bar, we're using the `appearance: none` property to remove the default styling for the range input, and we're using the `::-webkit-slider-thumb` pseudo-element to style the thumb of the slider.


To add audio controls using the HTML5 audio element, you can start by adding an `<audio>` tag to your HTML code with the `controls` attribute. Here's an example:


```vue
html`<audio src="audio.mp3" controls></audio>
```
In the above example, we have an `<audio>` element with a `src` attribute that specifies the location of the audio file. The `controls` attribute adds the default audio controls (play/pause, volume, etc.) to the audio player.

You can use CSS to style the audio controls. Here's an example of some basic CSS that can be used to style the default audio controls:


```vue
audio {
 width: 100%;
 margin: 20px 0;
}

/\* Style the play/pause button \*/
audio::-webkit-media-controls-play-button {
 background-color: #000;
 border-radius: 50%;
 height: 50px;
 width: 50px;
}

/\* Style the volume control \*/
audio::-webkit-media-controls-volume-slider {
 width: 100px;
 height: 10px;
 margin: 0 10px;
 background-color: #ccc;
}

audio::-webkit-media-controls-volume-slider::-webkit-slider-thumb {
 appearance: none;
 height: 20px;
 width: 20px;
 background-color: #000;
 border-radius: 50%;
}
```
In the above CSS, we're using the `::-webkit-media-controls-*` pseudo-elements to style the default audio controls. We're also using the `appearance: none` property to remove the default styling for the volume control thumb, and we're using the `::-webkit-slider-thumb` pseudo-element to style the thumb of the volume control.

Note that the above CSS only works in webkit-based browsers (such as Google Chrome and Safari). To style the default audio controls in other browsers, you'll need to use vendor-specific prefixes or JavaScript.


To create a playlist with Vue.js, you can start by setting up the Vue.js environment and creating a Vue instance. Here's an example of how you can do that:


```vue
html`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
 <meta charset="UTF-8">
 <title>Vue.js Playlist</title>
 <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@next"></script>
</head>
<body>
 <div id="app">
 <h1>My Playlist</h1>
 <ul>
 <li v-for="(song, index) in songs" :key="index">{{ song.title }} - {{ song.artist }}</li>
 </ul>
 </div>

 <script>
 const app = Vue.createApp({
 data() {
 return {
 songs: [
 { title: 'Song 1', artist: 'Artist 1' },
 { title: 'Song 2', artist: 'Artist 2' },
 { title: 'Song 3', artist: 'Artist 3' },
 { title: 'Song 4', artist: 'Artist 4' },
 { title: 'Song 5', artist: 'Artist 5' },
 ]
 }
 }
 })

 app.mount('#app')
 </script>
</body>
</html>
```
In the above code, we're creating a Vue instance using the `Vue.createApp()` method. We're also defining a `data` object that contains an array of songs.

We're using the `v-for` directive to loop through the songs array and render a list item for each song. The `:key` attribute is used to set a unique key for each list item.

You can add more properties to the `data` object to represent additional information about the songs, such as the album or the length of the song. You can also add methods to the Vue instance to handle events, such as adding or removing songs from the playlist.

Here's an example of how you can add a method to the Vue instance to add a new song to the playlist:


```vue
html`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
 <meta charset="UTF-8">
 <title>Vue.js Playlist</title>
 <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@next"></script>
</head>
<body>
 <div id="app">
 <h1>My Playlist</h1>
 <ul>
 <li v-for="(song, index) in songs" :key="index">{{ song.title }} - {{ song.artist }}</li>
 </ul>
 <form @submit.prevent="addSong">
 <label>
 Title:
 <input type="text" v-model="newSong.title">
 </label>
 <label>
 Artist:
 <input type="text" v-model="newSong.artist">
 </label>
 <button type="submit">Add Song</button>
 </form>
 </div>

 <script>
 const app = Vue.createApp({
 data() {
 return {
 songs: [
 { title: 'Song 1', artist: 'Artist 1' },
 { title: 'Song 2', artist: 'Artist 2' },
 { title: 'Song 3', artist: 'Artist 3' },
 { title: 'Song 4', artist: 'Artist 4' },
 { title: 'Song 5', artist: 'Artist 5' },
 ],
 newSong: {
 title: '',
 artist: ''
 }
 }
 },
 methods: {
 addSong() {
 this.songs.push(this.newSong)
```

To add the ability to skip tracks and adjust volume in a Vue.js playlist, you can use the HTML5 audio element and the Vue.js event handling system. Here's an example of how you can modify the previous code to add these features:


```vue
html`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
 <meta charset="UTF-8">
 <title>Vue.js Playlist</title>
 <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@next"></script>
</head>
<body>
 <div id="app">
 <h1>My Playlist</h1>
 <ul>
 <li v-for="(song, index) in songs" :key="index" @click="selectSong(index)">{{ song.title }} - {{ song.artist }}</li>
 </ul>
 <div>
 <button :disabled="!hasPrevious()" @click="previousSong()">Previous</button>
 <button :disabled="!hasNext()" @click="nextSong()">Next</button>
 </div>
 <div>
 <label>
 Volume:
 <input type="range" min="0" max="1" step="0.01" v-model="volume">
 </label>
 </div>
 </div>

 <script>
 const app = Vue.createApp({
 data() {
 return {
 songs: [
 { title: 'Song 1', artist: 'Artist 1', src: 'song1.mp3' },
 { title: 'Song 2', artist: 'Artist 2', src: 'song2.mp3' },
 { title: 'Song 3', artist: 'Artist 3', src: 'song3.mp3' },
 { title: 'Song 4', artist: 'Artist 4', src: 'song4.mp3' },
 { title: 'Song 5', artist: 'Artist 5', src: 'song5.mp3' },
 ],
 currentSongIndex: 0,
 audio: new Audio(),
 volume: 0.5
 }
 },
 mounted() {
 this.audio.addEventListener('ended', () => {
 this.nextSong()
 })
 this.audio.addEventListener('timeupdate', () => {
 console.log('Current time:', this.audio.currentTime)
 })
 },
 methods: {
 selectSong(index) {
 this.currentSongIndex = index
 this.audio.src = this.songs[index].src
 this.audio.play()
 },
 previousSong() {
 if (this.hasPrevious()) {
 this.currentSongIndex--
 this.audio.src = this.songs[this.currentSongIndex].src
 this.audio.play()
 }
 },
 nextSong() {
 if (this.hasNext()) {
 this.currentSongIndex++
 this.audio.src = this.songs[this.currentSongIndex].src
 this.audio.play()
 }
 },
 hasPrevious() {
 return this.currentSongIndex > 0
 },
 hasNext() {
 return this.currentSongIndex < this.songs.length - 1
 }
 },
 watch: {
 volume(newVolume) {
 this.audio.volume = newVolume
 }
 }
 })

 app.mount('#app')
 </script>
</body>
</html>
```
In this example, we've added two buttons to skip to the previous or next song in the playlist. We've also added an input range element to adjust the volume.

We've defined a new data property `currentSongIndex` to keep track of the index of the currently selected song. We've also created a new `Audio` object in the `data` object to represent the audio player.

We


To style the player with CSS and add animations, we can modify the existing HTML and Vue.js code to include CSS classes and animation properties. Here's an example of how you can modify the previous code to add styling and animations:


```vue
html`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
 <meta charset="UTF-8">

# Chapter 8: Building a Movie Search App
To use the OMDB API to search for movies, we can make HTTP requests from our Vue.js application using the `axios` library. Here's an example of how you can modify the previous code to search for movies:


```vue
html`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
 <meta charset="UTF-8">
 <title>Movie Search</title>
 <style>
 body {
 font-family: sans-serif;
 }
 input[type="search"] {
 width: 100%;
 padding: 0.5em;
 margin: 0.5em 0;
 }
 ul {
 list-style: none;
 padding: 0;
 margin: 0;
 }
 li {
 padding: 0.5em;
 margin: 0.5em;
 cursor: pointer;
 transition: background-color 0.3s ease;
 }
 li:hover {
 background-color: #ddd;
 }
 </style>
 <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@next"></script>
 <script src="https://unpkg.com/axios@0.21.1/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
 <div id="app">
 <h1>Movie Search</h1>
 <form @submit.prevent="searchMovies">
 <label>
 Search:
 <input type="search" v-model="searchTerm">
 </label>
 <button type="submit">Search</button>
 </form>
 <ul v-if="movies.length">
 <li v-for="(movie, index) in movies" :key="index" @click="selectMovie(index)">{{ movie.Title }} ({{ movie.Year }})</li>
 </ul>
 <p v-else>No movies found.</p>
 </div>

 <script>
 const app = Vue.createApp({
 data() {
 return {
 searchTerm: '',
 movies: [],
 selectedMovie: null,
 };
 },
 methods: {
 async searchMovies() {
 const { data } = await axios.get('https://www.omdbapi.com/', {
 params: {
 apikey: 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE',
 s: this.searchTerm,
 },
 });

 if (data.Response === 'True') {
 this.movies = data.Search;
 this.selectedMovie = null;
 } else {
 this.movies = [];
 this.selectedMovie = null;
 }
 },
 selectMovie(index) {
 this.selectedMovie = this.movies[index];
 },
 },
 });

 app.mount('#app');
 </script>
</body>
</html>
```
In this example, we added a form with an input field and a button to search for movies. When the form is submitted, the `searchMovies` method is called, which makes an HTTP GET request to the OMDB API using the `axios` library. The `searchTerm` data property is used to pass the search term to the API, and the `apikey` parameter is set to your own OMDB API key.

The API response is stored in the `movies` data property if the `Response` field is `'True'`, and an error message is displayed if it is not. The `movies` data property is then used to display the search results in a list. When a movie is clicked, the `selectMovie` method is called to set the `selectedMovie` data property, which can be used to display more information about the movie.


To display movie posters and details in our Vue.js application using the OMDB API, we can modify the previous code to fetch additional information about a selected movie and display it on the page. Here's an example:


```vue
html`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
 <meta charset="UTF-8">
 <title>Movie Search</title>
 <style>
 body {
 font-family: sans-serif;
 }
 input[type="search"] {
 width: 100%;
 padding: 0.5em;
 margin: 0.5em 0;
 }
 ul {
 list-style: none;
 padding: 0;
 margin: 0;
 }
 li {
 padding: 0.5em;
 margin: 0.5em;
 cursor: pointer;
 transition: background-color 0.3s ease;
 }
 li:hover {
 background-color: #ddd;
 }
 .movie-details {
 display: flex;
 margin-top: 2em;
 }
 .movie-poster {
 width: 150px;
 height: 225px;
 object-fit: cover;
 margin-right: 1em;
 }
 .movie-info {
 flex-grow: 1;
 }
 .movie-title {
 font-size: 1.5em;
 margin: 0;
 }
 .movie-rating {
 font-size: 1.2em;
 margin: 0.5em 0;
 }
 .movie-plot {
 margin: 0.5em 0;
 }
 </style>
 <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@next"></script>
 <script src="https://unpkg.com/axios@0.21.1/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
 <div id="app">
 <h1>Movie Search</h1>
 <form @submit.prevent="searchMovies">
 <label>
 Search:
 <input type="search" v-model="searchTerm">
 </label>
 <button type="submit">Search</button>
 </form>
 <ul v-if="movies.length">
 <li v-for="(movie, index) in movies" :key="index" @click="selectMovie(index)">
 {{ movie.Title }} ({{ movie.Year }})
 <img :src="movie.Poster" alt="" height="50">
 </li>
 </ul>
 <p v-else>No movies found.</p>
 <div class="movie-details" v-if="selectedMovie">
 <img class="movie-poster" :src="selectedMovie.Poster" alt="">
 <div class="movie-info">
 <h2 class="movie-title">{{ selectedMovie.Title }} ({{ selectedMovie.Year }})</h2>
 <p class="movie-rating">IMDB Rating: {{ selectedMovie.imdbRating }}</p>
 <p class="movie-plot">{{ selectedMovie.Plot }}</p>
 </div>
 </div>
 </div>

 <script>
 const app = Vue.createApp({
 data() {
 return {
 searchTerm: '',
 movies: [],
 selectedMovie: null,
 };
 },
 methods: {
 async searchMovies() {
 const { data } = await axios.get('https://www.omdbapi.com/', {
 params: {
 apikey: 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE',
 s: this.searchTerm,
 },
 });

 if (data.Response === 'True') {
 this.movies = data.Search;
 this.selectedMovie = null;
```

To add a filter to search by genre or year, we can modify our existing `searchMovies` method to include additional search parameters. We can also update our template to include input fields for genre and year.

Here's an example:


```vue
html`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
 <meta charset="UTF-8">
 <title>Movie Search</title>
 <style>
 body {
 font-family: sans-serif;
 }
 input[type="search"], select {
 width: 100%;
 padding: 0.5em;
 margin: 0.5em 0;
 }
 ul {
 list-style: none;
 padding: 0;
 margin: 0;
 }
 li {
 padding: 0.5em;
 margin: 0.5em;
 cursor: pointer;
 transition: background-color 0.3s ease;
 }
 li:hover {
 background-color: #ddd;
 }
 .movie-details {
 display: flex;
 margin-top: 2em;
 }
 .movie-poster {
 width: 150px;
 height: 225px;
 object-fit: cover;
 margin-right: 1em;
 }
 .movie-info {
 flex-grow: 1;
 }
 .movie-title {
 font-size: 1.5em;
 margin: 0;
 }
 .movie-rating {
 font-size: 1.2em;
 margin: 0.5em 0;
 }
 .movie-plot {
 margin: 0.5em 0;
 }
 </style>
 <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@next"></script>
 <script src="https://unpkg.com/axios@0.21.1/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
 <div id="app">
 <h1>Movie Search</h1>
 <form @submit.prevent="searchMovies">
 <label>
 Search:
 <input type="search" v-model="searchTerm">
 </label>
 <label>
 Genre:
 <select v-model="searchGenre">
 <option value="">All Genres</option>
 <option v-for="genre in genres" :key="genre" :value="genre">{{ genre }}</option>
 </select>
 </label>
 <label>
 Year:
 <select v-model="searchYear">
 <option value="">All Years</option>
 <option v-for="year in years" :key="year" :value="year">{{ year }}</option>
 </select>
 </label>
 <button type="submit">Search</button>
 </form>
 <ul v-if="movies.length">
 <li v-for="(movie, index) in movies" :key="index" @click="selectMovie(index)">
 {{ movie.Title }} ({{ movie.Year }})
 <img :src="movie.Poster" alt="" height="50">
 </li>
 </ul>
 <p v-else>No movies found.</p>
 <div class="movie-details" v-if="selectedMovie">
 <img class="movie-poster" :src="selectedMovie.Poster" alt="">
 <div class="movie-info">
 <h2 class="movie-title">{{ selectedMovie.Title }} ({{ selectedMovie.Year }})</h2>
 <p class="movie-rating">IMDB Rating: {{ selectedMovie.imdbRating }}</p>
 <p class="movie-plot">{{ selectedMovie.Plot }}</p>
 </div>
 </
```

To add the ability to save favorite movies, we can modify our existing code to include a button to add/remove the movie from the list of favorites. We can also add a separate section to display the list of favorite movies.

Here's an example:


```vue
html`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
 <meta charset="UTF-8">
 <title>Movie Search</title>
 <style>
 body {
 font-family: sans-serif;
 }
 input[type="search"], select {
 width: 100%;
 padding: 0.5em;
 margin: 0.5em 0;
 }
 ul {
 list-style: none;
 padding: 0;
 margin: 0;
 }
 li {
 padding: 0.5em;
 margin: 0.5em;
 cursor: pointer;
 transition: background-color 0.3s ease;
 }
 li:hover {
 background-color: #ddd;
 }
 .movie-details {
 display: flex;
 margin-top: 2em;
 }
 .movie-poster {
 width: 150px;
 height: 225px;
 object-fit: cover;
 margin-right: 1em;
 }
 .movie-info {
 flex-grow: 1;
 }
 .movie-title {
 font-size: 1.5em;
 margin: 0;
 }
 .movie-rating {
 font-size: 1.2em;
 margin: 0.5em 0;
 }
 .movie-plot {
 margin: 0.5em 0;
 }
 .favorite-movies {
 margin-top: 2em;
 }
 .favorite-movies li {
 display: flex;
 align-items: center;
 }
 .favorite-movies img {
 margin-right: 1em;
 }
 .favorite-movies button {
 margin-left: auto;
 }

To style the app, we can modify the existing CSS to change the appearance of the different elements. We can also add new CSS rules to style the new elements we added for saving favorite movies.

# Chapter 9: Building a Recipe App
To use the Spoonacular API to search for recipes, we need to make HTTP requests to the API endpoint and parse the response data. We can use the Axios library to make the requests and Vue.js to handle the data and update the UI.

Here's an example of how to search for recipes using the Spoonacular API:


```vue
html`<template>
 <div class="container">
 <h1>Recipe Search</h1>
 <form @submit.prevent="searchRecipes">
 <label for="query">Search:</label>
 <input type="text" id="query" v-model="query">
 <button type="submit">Search</button>
 </form>
 <ul>
 <li v-for="recipe in recipes" :key="recipe.id">
 <img :src="recipe.image" :alt="recipe.title">
 <h2>{{ recipe.title }}</h2>
 <p>{{ recipe.summary }}</p>
 <button @click="toggleFavorite(recipe)">
 {{ isFavorite(recipe) ? 'Remove from favorites' : 'Add to favorites' }}
 </button>
 </li>
 </ul>
 </div>
</template>

<script>
import axios from 'axios';

export default {
 data() {
 return {
 query: '',
 recipes: [],
 favorites: []
 };
 },
 methods: {
 searchRecipes() {
 axios
 .get('https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/search', {
 params: {
 query: this.query,
 apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY'
 }
 })
 .then(response => {
 this.recipes = response.data.results;
 })
 .catch(error => {
 console.error(error);
 });
 },
 toggleFavorite(recipe) {
 if (this.isFavorite(recipe)) {
 this.favorites = this.favorites.filter(favorite => favorite.id !== recipe.id);
 } else {
 this.favorites.push(recipe);
 }
 },
 isFavorite(recipe) {
 return this.favorites.some(favorite => favorite.id === recipe.id);
 }
 }
};
</script>

<style>
/\* add your own styles here \*/
</style>
```
In this example, we have a search form with a text input and a button that triggers the `searchRecipes` method when submitted. The method makes an HTTP GET request to the Spoonacular API endpoint and passes the search query and the API key as query parameters. When the response is received, the `recipes` data property is updated with an array of recipe objects returned by the API.

Each recipe is displayed as a list item with an image, a title, a summary, and a button to add or remove it from the list of favorites. The `toggleFavorite` method adds or removes a recipe from the `favorites` array based on whether it's already in the list or not. The `isFavorite` method returns true if a recipe is in the `favorites` array.

Note that you'll need to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual Spoonacular API key to make this example work. Also, make sure to follow the API usage guidelines and rate limits to avoid getting blocked.


To display recipe details and ingredients, we can use the Spoonacular API again to fetch more information about a specific recipe. We can make another HTTP request to the API endpoint using the `recipeId` property of the recipe object, which is returned by the search API.

Here's an example of how to display recipe details and ingredients using Vue.js and the Spoonacular API:


```vue
html`<template>
 <div class="container">
 <h1>{{ recipe.title }}</h1>
 <img :src="recipe.image" :alt="recipe.title">
 <p>{{ recipe.summary }}</p>
 <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
 <ul>
 <li v-for="ingredient in ingredients" :key="ingredient.id">{{ ingredient.name }}</li>
 </ul>
 </div>
</template>

<script>
import axios from 'axios';

export default {
 data() {
 return {
 recipe: {},
 ingredients: []
 };
 },
 mounted() {
 this.fetchRecipeDetails();
 },
 methods: {
 fetchRecipeDetails() {
 axios
 .get(`https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/${this.$route.params.id}/information`, {
 params: {
 apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY'
 }
 })
 .then(response => {
 this.recipe = response.data;
 this.ingredients = response.data.extendedIngredients;
 })
 .catch(error => {
 console.error(error);
 });
 }
 }
};
</script>

<style>
/\* add your own styles here \*/
</style>
```
In this example, we have a recipe details page that shows the title, image, summary, and ingredients of a recipe. We use the `mounted` lifecycle hook to call the `fetchRecipeDetails` method when the component is loaded. The method makes an HTTP GET request to the Spoonacular API endpoint with the `recipeId` parameter passed as a route parameter using `this.$route.params.id`.

When the response is received, the `recipe` data property is updated with the recipe object returned by the API, and the `ingredients` data property is updated with an array of ingredient objects returned by the API. We then use `v-for` to iterate over the `ingredients` array and display each ingredient name in a list item.

Note that you'll need to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual Spoonacular API key to make this example work. Also, make sure to follow the API usage guidelines and rate limits to avoid getting blocked.


To add the ability to save favorite recipes, we can use browser local storage to store an array of favorite recipe IDs. When a user clicks a "favorite" button on a recipe, we can add its ID to the array, and when the user navigates to their "favorites" page, we can fetch the details of each favorite recipe and display them.

Here's an example of how to add the ability to save favorite recipes using Vue.js and the Spoonacular API:


```vue
html`<template>
 <div class="container">
 <h1>{{ recipe.title }}</h1>
 <img :src="recipe.image" :alt="recipe.title">
 <p>{{ recipe.summary }}</p>
 <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
 <ul>
 <li v-for="ingredient in ingredients" :key="ingredient.id">{{ ingredient.name }}</li>
 </ul>
 <button @click="toggleFavorite">{{ isFavorite ? 'Remove from Favorites' : 'Add to Favorites' }}</button>
 </div>
</template>

<script>
import axios from 'axios';

export default {
 data() {
 return {
 recipe: {},
 ingredients: [],
 isFavorite: false
 };
 },
 mounted() {
 this.fetchRecipeDetails();
 this.checkFavorite();
 },
 methods: {
 fetchRecipeDetails() {
 axios
 .get(`https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/${this.$route.params.id}/information`, {
 params: {
 apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY'
 }
 })
 .then(response => {
 this.recipe = response.data;
 this.ingredients = response.data.extendedIngredients;
 })
 .catch(error => {
 console.error(error);
 });
 },
 toggleFavorite() {
 let favorites = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('favorites')) || [];
 if (this.isFavorite) {
 favorites = favorites.filter(id => id !== this.recipe.id);
 localStorage.setItem('favorites', JSON.stringify(favorites));
 this.isFavorite = false;
 } else {
 favorites.push(this.recipe.id);
 localStorage.setItem('favorites', JSON.stringify(favorites));
 this.isFavorite = true;
 }
 },
 checkFavorite() {
 let favorites = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('favorites')) || [];
 this.isFavorite = favorites.includes(this.recipe.id);
 }
 }
};
</script>

<style>
/\* add your own styles here \*/
</style>
```
In this example, we've added a "favorite" button to the recipe details page. The button's label changes depending on whether the recipe is currently marked as a favorite. When the button is clicked, we use the `localStorage` object to store or remove the recipe's ID in an array of favorite recipe IDs. We also update the `isFavorite` data property to reflect the new state.

In the `checkFavorite` method, we check if the recipe's ID is already in the array of favorite recipe IDs stored in `localStorage`, and update the `isFavorite` data property accordingly.

You can then create a separate "favorites" page that fetches the details of each favorite recipe and displays them in a list. To fetch the details of a favorite recipe, you can make an HTTP GET request to the Spoonacular API endpoint with the `recipeId` parameter passed as a route parameter, just like in the previous example.


To add a filter to search by cuisine or diet, we can modify our existing recipe search functionality to accept additional search parameters and update our API request to include them.

Here's an example of how to add a filter to search by cuisine or diet using Vue.js and the Spoonacular API:


```vue
html`<template>
 <div class="container">
 <h1>Search for Recipes</h1>
 <form @submit.prevent="searchRecipes">
 <label>
 Search:
 <input type="text" v-model="query">
 </label>
 <label>
 Cuisine:
 <select v-model="cuisine">
 <option value="">Any</option>
 <option v-for="cuisine in cuisines" :value="cuisine">{{ cuisine }}</option>
 </select>
 </label>
 <label>
 Diet:
 <select v-model="diet">
 <option value="">Any</option>
 <option v-for="diet in diets" :value="diet">{{ diet }}</option>
 </select>
 </label>
 <button type="submit">Search</button>
 </form>
 <ul>
 <li v-for="recipe in recipes" :key="recipe.id">
 <router-link :to="{ name: 'recipe', params: { id: recipe.id } }">
 {{ recipe.title }}
 </router-link>
 </li>
 </ul>
 </div>
</template>

<script>
import axios from 'axios';

export default {
 data() {
 return {
 query: '',
 cuisine: '',
 diet: '',
 cuisines: [],
 diets: [],
 recipes: []
 };
 },
 mounted() {
 this.fetchCuisines();
 this.fetchDiets();
 },
 methods: {
 fetchCuisines() {
 axios
 .get('https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/cuisines', {
 params: {
 apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY'
 }
 })
 .then(response => {
 this.cuisines = response.data;
 })
 .catch(error => {
 console.error(error);
 });
 },
 fetchDiets() {
 axios
 .get('https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/complexSearch', {
 params: {
 apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
 query: '',
 diet: 'list'
 }
 })
 .then(response => {
 this.diets = response.data.diets;
 })
 .catch(error => {
 console.error(error);
 });
 },
 searchRecipes() {
 axios
 .get('https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/complexSearch', {
 params: {
 apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
 query: this.query,
 cuisine: this.cuisine,
 diet: this.diet
 }
 })
 .then(response => {
 this.recipes = response.data.results;
 })
 .catch(error => {
 console.error(error);
 });
 }
 }
};
</script>

<style>
/\* add your own styles here \*/
</style>
```
In this example, we've added two select elements to the recipe search form for choosing a cuisine and a diet. We've also added `cuisines` and `diets` data properties to store the available options for each filter, and `fetchCuisines` and `fetchDiets` methods to fetch those options from the Spoonacular API.

We've then modified the `searchRecipes` method to include the `cuisine` and `diet` search parameters in the API request, along with the existing `query` parameter.

When the search form is submitted, the


To style our app with CSS, we can add our own styles to the existing HTML structure and components we've created with Vue.js. Here's an example of how we could style our recipe search app:


```vue
html`<template>
 <div class="container">
 <h1 class="heading">Search for Recipes</h1>
 <form @submit.prevent="searchRecipes" class="search-form">
 <label class="search-label">

 <label class="search-label">
 Cuisine:
 <select v-model="cuisine" class="search-select">

 <option v-for="cuisine in cuisines" :value="cuisine">{{ cuisine }}</option>
 </select>
 </label>
 <label class="search-label">
 Diet:
 <select v-model="diet" class="search-select">
 <option value="">Any</option>
 <option v-for="diet in diets" :value="diet">{{ diet }}</option>
 </select>
 </label>
 <button type="submit" class="search-button">Search</button>
 </form>
 <ul class="recipe-list">
 <li v-for="recipe in recipes" :key="recipe.id" class="recipe-item">

 </li>
 </ul>
 </div>

import axios from 'axios';

export default {
 data() {
 return {
 query: '',
 cuisine: '',

# Chapter 10: Building a Bookstore App
Firebase is a platform that provides a number of services, including a real-time database that can be used to store and sync data in real time. To create a database with Firebase, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a Firebase project: Go to the Firebase console and create a new project. Follow the prompts to give your project a name and select the region.
2. Add Firebase to your app: If you haven't already done so, add Firebase to your app by following the steps provided in the Firebase console. This will involve adding some code to your app to initialize Firebase and connect to your project.
3. Create a database: Once Firebase is set up, you can create a real-time database by navigating to the "Database" section of the Firebase console and selecting "Create database". Choose the location and security rules for your database, and click "Create database".
4. Add data: You can add data to your database using the Firebase SDKs for your chosen platform. For example, if you are using JavaScript, you can use the Firebase Realtime Database SDK to write data to your database. Here is an example:


```vue
const firebase = require('firebase/app');
require('firebase/database');

const firebaseConfig = {
 apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
 authDomain: 'YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN',
 databaseURL: 'YOUR_DATABASE_URL',
 projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
 storageBucket: 'YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET',
 messagingSenderId: 'YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID',
 appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
 measurementId: 'YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID'
};

firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

const db = firebase.database();

// Write data to the database
db.ref('users').push({
 name: 'John Doe',
 email: 'johndoe@example.com'
});
```
This code initializes Firebase and sets up a reference to the "users" node in the database. It then uses the `push` method to add a new object to the "users" node with a name and email property.

5. Read data: You can read data from your database using the Firebase SDKs. Here is an example in JavaScript:


```vue
// Read data from the database
db.ref('users').on('value', (snapshot) => {
 console.log(snapshot.val());
});
```
This code sets up a listener for the "users" node in the database. Whenever data changes at this node, the listener will be triggered and the data will be logged to the console.

6. Update and delete data: You can update and delete data in your database using the Firebase SDKs. Here is an example in JavaScript:


```vue
// Update data in the database
db.ref('users/-Lk5r5x5TW6NfAG7zPbj').update({
 email: 'newemail@example.com'
});

// Delete data from the database
db.ref('users/-Lk5r5x5TW6NfAG7zPbj').remove();
```
This code updates the email property of a specific user in the "users" node using the `update` method, and then deletes that user using the `remove` method.

Note that Firebase provides a number of other features and services, such as authentication, storage, and hosting, that can be integrated with your app as well.


To display a list of books, you can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's an example:

1. HTML structure: Start by creating an HTML structure for your book list. You can use an unordered list (`<ul>`) to hold the list items (`<li>`) for each book. For example:


```vue
html`<ul id="book-list">
 <li class="book-item">
 <div class="book-cover">
 <img src="book-cover.jpg" alt="Book cover">
 </div>
 <div class="book-details">
 <h2 class="book-title">Book Title</h2>
 <p class="book-author">Author Name</p>
 <p class="book-summary">Book summary...</p>
 </div>
 </li>
 <li class="book-item">
 <!-- Another book item -->
 </li>
 <!-- More book items -->
</ul>
```
2. CSS styling: Style your book list with CSS. You can use CSS to style the book cover, book details, and other elements of the book item. For example:


```vue
#book-list {
 list-style: none;
 margin: 0;
 padding: 0;
}

.book-item {
 display: flex;
 margin-bottom: 20px;
}

.book-cover img {
 max-width: 100%;
 height: auto;
}

.book-details {
 margin-left: 20px;
}

.book-title {
 font-size: 24px;
 margin: 0;
}

.book-author {
 font-size: 18px;
 margin: 0;
 margin-top: 10px;
}

.book-summary {
 font-size: 16px;
 margin: 0;
 margin-top: 10px;
 color: #666;
}
```
3. JavaScript code: To display a list of books dynamically, you can use JavaScript to fetch book data from an API and render it in your HTML structure. Here's an example using the Google Books API:


```vue
const bookList = document.querySelector('#book-list');

// Fetch book data from the Google Books API
fetch('https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=javascript')
 .then(response => response.json())
 .then(data => {
 // Loop through each book in the API response and render it
 data.items.forEach(book => {
 const bookItem = document.createElement('li');
 bookItem.classList.add('book-item');

 const bookCover = document.createElement('div');
 bookCover.classList.add('book-cover');

 const coverImage = document.createElement('img');
 coverImage.src = book.volumeInfo.imageLinks.thumbnail;
 coverImage.alt = book.volumeInfo.title;

 bookCover.appendChild(coverImage);

 const bookDetails = document.createElement('div');
 bookDetails.classList.add('book-details');

 const title = document.createElement('h2');
 title.classList.add('book-title');
 title.textContent = book.volumeInfo.title;

 const author = document.createElement('p');
 author.classList.add('book-author');
 author.textContent = `by ${book.volumeInfo.authors.join(', ')}`;

 const summary = document.createElement('p');
 summary.classList.add('book-summary');
 summary.textContent = book.volumeInfo.description;

 bookDetails.appendChild(title);
 bookDetails.appendChild(author);
 bookDetails.appendChild(summary);

 bookItem.appendChild(bookCover);
 bookItem.appendChild(bookDetails);

 bookList.appendChild(bookItem);
 });
 });
```
This code fetches book data from the Google Books API and loops through each book to create a new list item for each book. It creates the necessary HTML elements for each book and sets their content based on the


To add the ability to add books to the database, you can create a form in HTML where users can enter information about the book. Once the form is submitted, you can use JavaScript and Firebase to add the book to the database.

Here's an example code snippet for the HTML form:


```vue
<form id="add-book-form">
 <label for="title">Title:</label>
 <input type="text" id="title" name="title" required>

 <label for="author">Author:</label>
 <input type="text" id="author" name="author" required>

 <label for="published">Published:</label>
 <input type="text" id="published" name="published" required>

 <button type="submit">Add Book</button>
</form>
```
In this example, the form includes input fields for the book title, author, and publication year. The form also includes a submit button.

Here's an example code snippet for the JavaScript code to add the book to the Firebase database:


```vue
const addBookForm = document.querySelector('#add-book-form');

addBookForm.addEventListener('submit', (e) => {
 e.preventDefault();

 const title = addBookForm.title.value;
 const author = addBookForm.author.value;
 const published = addBookForm.published.value;

 const book = {
 title,
 author,
 published,
 };

 firebase.firestore().collection('books').add(book)
 .then(() => {
 console.log('Book added to database');
 addBookForm.reset();
 })
 .catch((error) => {
 console.error('Error adding book to database: ', error);
 });
});
```
In this example, the JavaScript code listens for the form's submit event. Once the event is triggered, the code retrieves the values from the form's input fields and creates a book object. The book object is then added to the Firebase "books" collection using the `add()` method.

After the book is successfully added to the database, the form is reset to allow the user to add another book. If there is an error adding the book to the database, an error message is logged to the console.


To add the ability to edit and delete books from the database, you can add buttons to each book listing that allow the user to perform these actions. When the user clicks the edit button, a modal form can be displayed with the current book details pre-filled, allowing the user to update the information. When the user clicks the delete button, a confirmation prompt can be displayed to ensure the user wants to delete the book.

Here's an example code snippet for displaying a list of books with edit and delete buttons:


```vue
<ul id="book-list"></ul>

<template id="book-template">
 <li data-id="{{id}}">
 <span class="title">{{title}}</span>
 <span class="author">{{author}}</span>
 <span class="published">{{published}}</span>
 <button class="edit-btn">Edit</button>
 <button class="delete-btn">Delete</button>
 </li>
</template>
```
In this example, the `book-list` unordered list is where the books will be displayed. The `book-template` is a hidden template that will be used to create the book listings.

Here's an example code snippet for the JavaScript code to display the books and handle the edit and delete buttons:


```vue
const bookList = document.querySelector('#book-list');

// Function to create a book listing from the book data
function createBookListing(book) {
 const template = document.querySelector('#book-template');
 const li = document.importNode(template.content.firstElementChild, true);
 li.dataset.id = book.id;
 li.querySelector('.title').textContent = book.title;
 li.querySelector('.author').textContent = book.author;
 li.querySelector('.published').textContent = book.published;
 li.querySelector('.edit-btn').addEventListener('click', () => {
 editBook(book);
 });
 li.querySelector('.delete-btn').addEventListener('click', () => {
 deleteBook(book);
 });
 return li;
}

// Function to display the books in the book list
function displayBooks(books) {
 bookList.innerHTML = '';
 books.forEach(book => {
 bookList.appendChild(createBookListing(book));
 });
}

// Function to edit a book
function editBook(book) {
 // Display a modal form with the current book details pre-filled
 // Allow the user to update the information
 // Save the updated book to the database
}

// Function to delete a book
function deleteBook(book) {
 const confirmation = confirm(`Are you sure you want to delete "${book.title}"?`);
 if (confirmation) {
 firebase.firestore().collection('books').doc(book.id).delete()
 .then(() => {
 console.log('Book deleted from database');
 })
 .catch((error) => {
 console.error('Error deleting book from database: ', error);
 });
 }
}
```
In this example, the `createBookListing` function takes a book object and returns a book listing element with the book details and edit and delete buttons. The `displayBooks` function takes an array of book objects and adds them to the `bookList` element by creating a book listing for each book using the `createBookListing` function.

The `editBook` function will be called when the user clicks the edit button on a book listing. This function should display a modal form with the current book details pre-filled, allow the user to update the information, and save the updated book to the database.

The `deleteBook` function will be called when the user clicks the delete button on a book listing. This function should display a confirmation prompt to ensure the user wants to delete the book, and then delete the book from the database using the `delete` method on the book's document reference.

Sure, I can help you with that. Here is a technical article about getting started with vuepress_theme_cool and vuepress:

---

## Getting Started with Vuepress Theme Cool and Vuepress

Vuepress is a static site generator based on Vue.js that allows you to easily create documentation websites or any other kind of website that requires structured content. It features a built-in Markdown editor, support for custom themes, and plugins that extend its functionality.

Vuepress Theme Cool is a custom theme for Vuepress that provides libraries for markdown-based diagramming tools, sortable/filterable table components and chartjs. It also inherits from the base Vuepress theme and supports all its features.

In this article, we will show you how to set up a simple website using Vuepress Theme Cool and Vuepress.

### Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you will need:

- Node.js version 10 or higher installed on your machine
- Yarn package manager installed on your machine
- A code editor of your choice (we recommend Visual Studio Code)

### Installing Vuepress and Vuepress Theme Cool

First, we need to install Vuepress globally using Yarn:

```bash
yarn global add vuepress@next
```

We use the `@next` tag to install the latest version of Vuepress (v1.x), which is compatible with Vuepress Theme Cool.

Next, we need to create a new folder for our project and initialize it as a Node.js project:

```bash
mkdir vuepress-cool-demo
cd vuepress-cool-demo
yarn init -y
```

This will create a `package.json` file with some default values.

Then, we need to install Vuepress Theme Cool as a development dependency:

```bash
yarn add -D vuepress-theme-cool
```

This will download the theme package and add it to our `package.json` file.

### Configuring Vuepress

Now that we have installed the necessary packages, we need to configure Vuepress to use our theme and enable some features.

To do that, we need to create a `.vuepress` folder inside our project folder and add a `config.js` file inside it. This file will contain our main configuration options for Vuepress.

A minimal setup for our config file is:

```js
// .vuepress/config.js

// this represents the minimal configuration
module.exports = {
  // specify the theme name
  theme: 'cool',
  // enable some markdown extensions
  markdown: {
    extendMarkdown: (md) => {
      // enable HTML tags in markdown source
      md.set({ html: true });
      // enable KaTeX for math expressions
      md.use(require('markdown-it-katex'));
      // enable PlantUML for diagrams
      md.use(require('markdown-it-plantuml'));
      // enable Admonition for callouts
      md.use(require('markdown-it-admonition'));
    },
  },
};
```

As you can see, we specify the theme name as `'cool'`, which tells Vuepress to use our custom theme. We also enable some markdown extensions that allow us to use HTML tags, KaTeX math expressions, PlantUML diagrams and Admonition callouts in our markdown files.

### Creating Content

Now that we have configured Vuepress, we can start creating some content for our website.

To do that, we need to create a `docs` folder inside our project folder and add some markdown files inside it. These files will represent our pages on the website.

For example, let's create an `index.md` file inside the `docs` folder with this content:

```md
# Welcome to my website!

This is an example website using [VuePress](https://vuepres.vuejs.org) and [VuePress Theme Cool](https://github.com/FriendlyUser/vuepress-theme-cool).

You can write any content here using **Markdown** syntax.

You can also use some **extensions** like:

- HTML tags: <span style="color:red">This is red</span>
- KaTeX math expressions: $E=mc^2$
- PlantUML diagrams:
@startuml 
Alice -> Bob : hello 
@enduml 
- Admonition callouts:
::: tip Tip 
This is a tip 
:::
```

This file will be rendered as the homepage of our website. You can see how it looks like by running this command in your terminal:

```bash
vuepress dev docs/
```

This will start a local development server at http://localhost:8080/ where you can preview your website live.

# Chapter 12: Building a Job Board App
Sure, here's a general overview of how you can use the GitHub Jobs API to search for jobs:

1. First, sign up for a GitHub account if you don't already have one. Then, go to the GitHub Jobs API documentation and review the available endpoints, parameters, and response formats.
2. To search for jobs, use the "GET /positions.json" endpoint and specify the search parameters such as location, description, and full-time status. You can also use the "GET /positions/:id.json" endpoint to retrieve details about a specific job.
3. To authenticate your requests and avoid rate limits, you can use your GitHub account token as a query parameter or header. You can also use libraries such as "axios" or "fetch" to make HTTP requests to the API and parse the JSON response.
4. Once you retrieve the job listings, you can display them on your website or application using HTML and CSS. You can also use JavaScript or a front-end framework such as React or Vue to create interactive features such as search filters, pagination, or job applications.
5. If you want to automate your job search, you can use tools such as "Zapier" or "IFTTT" to trigger notifications or alerts based on new job listings that match your criteria.

That's a basic overview of how you can use the GitHub Jobs API to search for jobs. Keep in mind that the API is subject to rate limits and may not always have up-to-date or accurate job listings. You should also follow the API terms of service and attribution guidelines when using the data in your projects.


Sure, here's a general overview of how you can display job details and requirements when using the GitHub Jobs API:

1. Once you retrieve job listings from the API using the search parameters, you can display them on your website or application. To do so, you can use HTML and CSS to format the job listings and display them in a readable format.
2. When a user clicks on a specific job listing, you can use JavaScript or a front-end framework such as React or Vue to retrieve the details and requirements of that job using the "GET /positions/:id.json" endpoint of the GitHub Jobs API. You can use the job listing ID to retrieve the corresponding details.
3. Once you have the details and requirements of the job, you can display them in a structured format. You can use HTML tags such as headings, paragraphs, and lists to display the job title, company name, job description, qualifications, and other details.
4. To format the job requirements, you can use CSS to style the content and make it visually appealing. You can also use JavaScript or a front-end framework to add interactive features such as collapsible sections, tooltips, or modal windows to display the requirements in a more user-friendly way.
5. To ensure that your job listings are up-to-date and accurate, you can periodically refresh the data from the API and update your website or application accordingly. You can also use caching techniques to reduce the API requests and improve the performance of your application.

That's a basic overview of how you can display job details and requirements when using the GitHub Jobs API. Keep in mind that the job details and requirements may vary depending on the API endpoint and the specific job listing. You should also consider the API terms of service and attribution guidelines when using the data in your projects.


Sure, here's a general overview of how you can add a filter to search by location or job title when using the GitHub Jobs API:

1. When making a request to the GitHub Jobs API, you can use query parameters to filter the search results based on location, job title, or other criteria. For example, you can use the "location" parameter to search for jobs in a specific city or country, or the "description" parameter to search for jobs that match a certain keyword.
2. To allow users to search for jobs by location or job title on your website or application, you can create input fields or dropdown menus where they can enter their search terms. You can use JavaScript or a front-end framework such as React or Vue to capture the user input and construct the API query based on their search terms.
3. When the user submits the search form, you can make a request to the GitHub Jobs API using the constructed query URL and retrieve the matching job listings. You can then display the job listings on your website or application using HTML and CSS.
4. To improve the user experience, you can use pagination or infinite scrolling to display the search results in manageable chunks. You can also use caching techniques to reduce the API requests and improve the performance of your application.
5. Additionally, you can provide additional search filters such as job type, company size, or salary range to allow users to narrow down their search further. You can use the corresponding query parameters of the GitHub Jobs API to implement these filters and construct the API query accordingly.

That's a basic overview of how you can add a filter to search by location or job title when using the GitHub Jobs API. Keep in mind that the API is subject to rate limits and may not always have up-to-date or accurate job listings. You should also follow the API terms of service and attribution guidelines when using the data in your projects.


Here's a general overview of how you can allow users to apply for jobs when using the GitHub Jobs API:

1. To allow users to apply for jobs, you need to provide a way for them to submit their application materials such as a resume, cover letter, or portfolio. You can create a form on your website or application where users can enter their personal and professional information, upload their application materials, and submit their application.
2. When a user submits their application, you need to send their information and materials to the employer or hiring manager of the job listing. You can use an email service or API to send the application to the designated recipient. Alternatively, you can provide a link or contact information for the user to submit their application directly to the employer.
3. To ensure that the user's application is accurate and complete, you can provide guidance and feedback throughout the application process. For example, you can display tips on how to write an effective cover letter, or provide a preview of the user's application materials before they submit them.
4. Additionally, you can use the GitHub Jobs API to provide more information about the job listing and the employer to help users make an informed decision before applying. For example, you can display the company's website, social media profiles, or reviews from other employees.
5. Finally, you should make sure to comply with any privacy, security, or legal requirements when collecting and processing user data. For example, you should obtain the user's consent to collect and store their information, and ensure that their data is protected from unauthorized access or misuse.

That's a basic overview of how you can allow users to apply for jobs when using the GitHub Jobs API. Keep in mind that the specific implementation may vary depending on the API endpoint and the employer's application process. You should also consider the API terms of service and attribution guidelines when using the data in your projects.


Here's a general overview of how you can style your app with CSS:

1. First, you need to identify the HTML elements that you want to style. You can use the developer tools in your web browser to inspect the page and view the HTML structure. You can also use a CSS framework or preprocessor to streamline the styling process and provide predefined styles.
2. Once you have identified the HTML elements, you can apply CSS styles to them using selectors and properties. Selectors are used to target specific elements, while properties are used to define the visual characteristics of the element such as color, font size, or padding. You can use inline styles, embedded stylesheets, or external stylesheets to apply CSS styles to your app.
3. To ensure that your CSS styles are applied consistently across different browsers and devices, you should use CSS best practices such as using a reset or normalize stylesheet, using relative units for sizing, and using semantic class names.
4. Additionally, you can use CSS animations and transitions to add visual effects and improve the user experience. Animations can be used to create movement or interactivity, while transitions can be used to smoothly change the appearance of an element. You can use CSS or JavaScript to implement animations and transitions.
5. Finally, you should test your app on different devices and screen sizes to ensure that the styling is responsive and adapts to different contexts. You can use media queries and breakpoints to adjust the styling based on the viewport size or device type.

That's a basic overview of how you can style your app with CSS. Keep in mind that the specific implementation may vary depending on the design requirements and the CSS framework or preprocessor used.
