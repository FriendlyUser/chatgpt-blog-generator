# Introduction

LaTeX is a document preparation system that has been used for decades to create professional-looking documents such as academic papers, books, and presentations. It was first developed in the 1980s by Leslie Lamport, and has since become the go-to tool for typesetting mathematical and technical documents.

Unlike other word processors, LaTeX is a markup language that separates content from formatting. This means that instead of focusing on how the document looks, you can concentrate on what you want to say. LaTeX takes care of the formatting, allowing you to produce high-quality documents with minimal effort.

In this book, we'll explore the basics of LaTeX, including how to create simple documents, how to format text, and how to add mathematical expressions. We'll also cover more advanced topics, such as document layout, macros, and bibliographies. By the end of this book, you'll have a solid understanding of how LaTeX works, and be able to create professional-looking documents of your own.

Whether you're a student writing a thesis, a researcher publishing a paper, or a technical writer creating documentation, LaTeX can help you produce documents that are both visually appealing and easy to read. So let's get started and learn how to use LaTeX to create your own high-quality documents.
