    src: "This book serves as a introduction to Javascript, asynchronous programming and node.js
JavaScript is a popular, high-level programming language used for creating interactive user experiences on the web. It is often used for front-end development, but it can also be used for back-end development using runtime environments like Node.js.

Node.js is a runtime environment for JavaScript that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server-side. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and is commonly used for building scalable and high-performance web applications.

Promises are a pattern in JavaScript that can be used to handle asynchronous operations. They provide a way to write cleaner and more organized asynchronous code, and they are often used in conjunction with Node.js and other technologies that make use of asynchronous programming."
