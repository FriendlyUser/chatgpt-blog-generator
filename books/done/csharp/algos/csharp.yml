seedPrompt: "Title: Introduction to Algorithms with CSharp. For the above title in a technical book use future prompts to write for a technical audience for a book and give concise explainations for code. Try not to repeat the code in the chapters. Ensure that all algorithms are implemented in Csharp. Respond with 'confirm' to acknowledge that you understand the prompt."
