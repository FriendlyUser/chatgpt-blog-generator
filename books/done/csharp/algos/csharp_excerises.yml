seedPrompt: "Title: Introduction to Algorithms with CSharp. For the above title in a technical book use future prompts to write solution to exercises for a technical audience for a book and give concise explainations for code. Try not to repeat the code in the chapters. Ensure that all algorithms are implemented in Csharp. Respond with 'confirm' to acknowledge that you understand the prompt."

  - 1. Given a set of tasks with their start and end times, find the maximum number of tasks that can be completed without overlapping. For example, for tasks [(1, 4), (2, 5), (4, 7), (6, 9)], the answer is 3.
  - 2. Given a set of intervals, find the minimum number of points that need to be placed such that each interval contains at least one point. For example, for intervals [(1, 3), (2, 5), (4, 7), (6, 9)], the answer is 2.
  - 3. Given a set of coins with their denominations, find the minimum number of coins needed to make a certain amount of money. For example, for coins [1, 5, 10, 25] and amount 67, the answer is 6 (3 of 25 and 2 of 10 and 2 of 1).
  - 4. Given a set of jobs with their weights and lengths, find the order in which to schedule the jobs such that the weighted completion time is minimized. The weighted completion time is the sum of the completion times of each job multiplied by its weight. For example, for jobs [(2, 4), (3, 1), (4, 2), (1, 3)], the answer is [(3, 1), (4, 2), (2, 4), (1, 3)].
  - 5. Given a set of activities with their start and end times, find the maximum number of non-overlapping activities that can be scheduled. For example, for activities [(1, 4), (3, 5), (0, 6), (5, 7), (3, 8), (5, 9), (6, 10), (8, 11), (8, 12), (2, 13), (12, 14)], the answer is 4.
  - 6. Given a set of tasks with their deadlines and durations, find the maximum profit that can be earned by completing the tasks before their respective deadlines. For example, for tasks [(4, 2), (2, 4), (4, 3), (3, 1), (1, 4)], the answer is 8.
  - 7. Given a set of jobs with their start and end times, find the maximum number of non-overlapping jobs that can be scheduled. For example, for jobs [(0, 6), (1, 4), (3, 5), (3, 8), (4, 7), (5, 7), (6, 10), (8, 11), (8, 12), (12, 14)], the answer is 4.
  - 8. Given a set of items with their values and weights, and a knapsack with a maximum capacity, find the maximum value that can be placed in the knapsack. For example, for items [(5, 2), (3, 1), (8, 3), (4, 2), (1, 1)] and a knapsack with capacity 5, the answer is 13.
  - 9. Given a set of buildings with their heights and positions, find the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all the buildings. A camera can monitor all buildings within a certain range. For example, for buildings [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (7, 8)] and a range of 1, the answer is 2.
  # - 10. Given a set of jobs with their profits

    src: "# Chapter 9: Divide and Conquer Algorithms"
  - 4. Write a C# program to find the kth smallest element in an unsorted array using Divide and Conquer approach.
  - 5. Implement the Karatsuba algorithm for fast multiplication of two large integers in C#.
  - 6. Write a C# program to find the closest pair of points in a plane using Divide and Conquer approach.
  - 7. Implement the Quick Sort algorithm using Divide and Conquer approach in C#.
  - 8. Write a C# program to find the inversion count of an array using Divide and Conquer approach.
  - 9. Implement the Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication in C# using Divide and Conquer approach.
  - 10. Write a C# program to find the maximum product of two integers in an array using Divide and Conquer approach.
