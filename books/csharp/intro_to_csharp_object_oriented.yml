sections:
  - Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts Explain the basic concepts of OOP such as classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction and polymorphism.
  - Classes and Objects in C# Explain how to define classes and create objects in C#. Provide examples of class definitions and object instantiation.
  - Constructors Explain what constructors are and how they are used to initialize objects. Provide examples of constructor definitions and usage.
  - Properties Explain what properties are and how they can be used to encapsulate data within a class. Provide examples of property definitions and usage.
  - Methods Explain what methods are and how they can be used to define the behavior of objects. Provide examples of method definitions and usage.
  - Inheritance Explain what inheritance is and how it can be used to create hierarchies of related classes. Provide examples of class inheritance in C#.
  - Polymorphism Explain what polymorphism is and how it can be achieved through method overriding or interface implementation. Provide examples of polymorphic behavior in C#.
  - Abstract Classes and Interfaces Explain the difference between abstract classes and interfaces, when to use each one, and how they can be used to achieve abstraction in C#. Provide examples of abstract class and interface definitions.
  - Exception Handling in classes Explain how exceptions can be handled using try-catch-finally blocks or using exception filters. Provide examples of exception handling in C#.
